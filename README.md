## Cloud-Computing-101-Copies-and-Summaries

#Cloud Computing Definition
  -is the on-demand delivery of IT recources over the internet with pay as you go pricing

- On demand delivery means a cloud provider has the resources you need when you need them
- IT recources over the internet - cloud computing has server, networks, storage, development tools, and applications
- Pay as you go pricing - pay only for what you need when you need it

Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the world's most comprehensive and broadly adopted cloud platform, offering over 200 fully featured services from data centers globally. It provides on-demand IT resources like computing power, database storage, and content delivery on a pay-as-you-go basis, allowing businesses to lower costs and scale infrastructure instant

#Deploying to the Cloud
  - Cloud service and deployment methods provide different levels of controls, flexibility and management
  - Deployment models include the following:
    * Infastructure as a service (IaaS)
    * Platform as a service (PaaS)
    * Software as a service (SaaS)

#Infastructure as a service (IaaS)
  - Infastructure as a service (IaaS) contains the basic building blocks for cloud IT. It typically provide access to networking features, computer(virtual or dedicated hardware), and data storage space.
    Infastructure as a service provides highest and management control over your IT recources.

#Platform as a service (PaaS) 
  - Platform as a service (PaaS) removes the need for organizations to manage the underlying infastructure (usually hardware and operating systems). They can focus on the deployment of applications
    These tools give developers the ability to be more effecient because they don't need to wory about the recource procurement, capacity planning, software maintenance and patching
    
#Software as a service (SaaS)
  - Software as a service (SaaS) is a completed software product that the service provider runs and manages. with a SaaS offering, you do not have to think about how the service is maintained
    or how the underlying infastructure is manage. You only must think about how you will use that particular piece of software

#Cloud deployment models
  - Cloud
      * In a cloud based deployment, you can migrate existing applications to the cloud, or you can design and build new applications in the cloud, you can build those on low level infastructure that requires your IT staff to manage
    them. Alternatively, you can build them by using higher level services that reduce the management, architecting and scaling requirements of the core infastructure.
  
  - Hybrid
      * In a hybrid deployment, cloud based resources are connected to on premises infastructure. You can integrate cloud-based recources with legacy IT applications. You might want to use this approach in a number of situatuins. For example, you have legacy applications that are better maintained on premises, or goverment requlations require your business to keep records on premises
  
  - On Premises
      * On premises deployment is also known as a private cloud deployment. In this model, resources are deployed on premises by using virtualization and recource management tools. Increase recource utilization by using application management and virtualization technologies
