## Cloud Computing 101 – Copies

## Cloud Computing Definition

Cloud computing is the **on-demand delivery of IT resources over the internet** with **pay-as-you-go pricing**.

* **On-demand delivery**: A cloud provider has the resources you need, when you need them.
* **IT resources over the internet**: Includes servers, networks, storage, development tools, and applications.
* **Pay-as-you-go pricing**: You pay only for what you use, when you use it.

**Amazon Web Services (AWS)** is the world’s most comprehensive and broadly adopted cloud platform. It offers over 200 fully featured services from data centers around the world. AWS provides on-demand IT resources such as computing power, database storage, and content delivery, allowing businesses to lower costs and scale infrastructure instantly.

## Deploying to the Cloud

Cloud services and deployment methods provide different levels of control, flexibility, and management.

### Cloud Service Models

* **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**
* **Platform as a Service (PaaS)**
* **Software as a Service (SaaS)**

---

## Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)

Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) provides the basic building blocks for cloud IT.

It typically includes:

* Networking features
* Computing resources (virtual machines or dedicated hardware)
* Data storage

IaaS provides the **highest level of flexibility and management control** over IT resources. The customer is responsible for managing the operating system, applications, and configurations.

---

## Platform as a Service (PaaS)

Platform as a Service (PaaS) removes the need for organizations to manage the underlying infrastructure (such as hardware and operating systems).

With PaaS:

* Developers focus on deploying and managing applications
* The cloud provider handles infrastructure, maintenance, and patching

These tools help developers work more efficiently because they do not need to worry about resource procurement, capacity planning, software maintenance, or system updates.

---

## Software as a Service (SaaS)

Software as a Service (SaaS) is a **complete software product** that the service provider runs and manages.

With SaaS:

* You do not manage the infrastructure or platform
* You only focus on how to use the software

Examples include email services, file storage platforms, and online productivity tools.

## Cloud Deployment Models

### Cloud (Public Cloud)

In a cloud-based deployment, applications run entirely in the cloud.

* You can migrate existing applications or build new ones directly in the cloud
* Applications can be built on low-level infrastructure that requires IT staff management
* Alternatively, higher-level services can be used to reduce infrastructure management, scaling, and architectural complexity

---

### Hybrid

In a hybrid deployment, **cloud-based resources are connected to on-premises infrastructure**.

This approach is useful when:

* Integrating cloud services with legacy IT applications
* Certain data must remain on-premises due to government regulations or compliance requirements
* Some applications perform better when maintained locally

---

### On-Premises (Private Cloud)

On-premises deployment is also known as a **private cloud deployment**.

In this model:

* Resources are hosted in the organization’s own data center
* Virtualization and resource management tools are used
* Application management and virtualization technologies help increase resource utilization

The organization is responsible for managing and maintaining all hardware and infrastructure.
